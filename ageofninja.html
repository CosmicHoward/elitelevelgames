		<h1>Age of Ninja</h1>
		<h2>Welcome to Boken</h2>
		<p>Age of Ninja is a fantasy roleplaying game in which players create ninja with extraordinary skills to complete missions full of danger and intrigue. As characters gain experince, players can use it to increase their skills and abilities, or add to their knowledge of ninjutsu techniques. Characters can use the treasures they amass to upgrade their armor, weapons and equipment. As characters grow, so do their reputations, allowing for varied and unique approaches to any given situation.</p>
		<p>In the land of Boken, adventure and danger are everpresent. The unexplored, forgotten lands hide hordes of monsters and the ancient evils that wait patiently to strike on an unsuspecting world. In the cities, secret societies and organized crime plot to upend entire civilizations and established communities. While most of these threats can be handled through the traditional methods - the city guard, or a king's army - some threats require levels of clandestine power and subterfuge the average guard or statesman could feasibly harness in the open. Such missions might require Ninja; men and women of near mythical skill and ability.</p>
		<p>In Age of Ninja, you and your friends can create such warriors, and journey through the land as a group gaining the reputations of power and infamy in the ways that only ninja could.</p>

		<h3>Robust and Expansive Character Creation</h3>
		<p>In Age of Ninja, there are no class restrictions. This skill-based system allows players to use their experience points to improve their characters any way they wish. With over 400 ninjutsu techniques, half a dozen Ninja clans, and hundreds of additional character-creation options and templates, the possibilities are almost endless!</p>
		<h3>Active Combat Mechanics</h3>
		<p>Age of Ninja gives players a more active "roll" in combat than most roleplaying games. Players can use techniques that allow for multi-character juggle attacks as well as interrupts, or reactions to an enemy attack on their ally. Beyond this, when players are attacked they make defense rolls, which may allow them to counter-attack their enemies.</p>
		<h3>Various Storytelling Options</h3>
		<p>This game is designed to handled multiple types of stories - from heavy combat-driven tales to stories steeped in dialogue and character interaction. In Age of Ninja there are many skills and techniques that are designed to handle interpersonal interactions; ideal for games where diplomacy and subterfuge are necessary to complete missions.</p>
